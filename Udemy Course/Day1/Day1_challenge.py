# Create a simple Brand name generator for a store
# by asking two creative questions

# Here I am asking two things from the user
# 1. What product you want to sell?
# 2. Type of the place : shop, store, corner point etc.

print("The brand name is: \n" + input("what product you are selling?\n") + " " + input("Is it a shop/store/Point?\n"))
